Website project for University of Glasgow Module - Internet Technology.
In random groups we have decided to create a cooking website in the Django Framework in Python which will utilise the OpenAI API, Spoonacular API & the Google Captcha API.

This website was developed using: 
- Open source images from UNISPLASH (https://unsplash.com/)
- Open source icons from FLATICON (https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Additional styling of the webpages implements styles from UIVERSE (https://uiverse.io/)
 
How to use the website?
- Use the following credentials to sign into into admin account:
username: admin, password: Admin123..
- Or create a user account
